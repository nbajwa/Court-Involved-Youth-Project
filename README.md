# Court-Involved-Youth-Project
Community Health Care Initiative

This is the culmination of 9 months of research into the healthcare, mental healthcare and social services available in 5 of Chicago zip codes that have the highest number of justice involved youth. 

The project started with a dive into communities to find out about existing services, then completed assessments with all providers listed to inventory and assess the programs and services they offer, with the goal of providing youth enough information about the services that many limitations would be removed. (eg, if they know that they will not be required to pay they may be more likely to go)
 
We want to use this dataset to give access to youth, providers, and systems staff so that young people leaving our jails and prisons can get the care and support they need within their communities.

The data collected was intially inputted into an exel document. In this next iteration of the project we will be parsing through the data and converting it into a rails API. The API is intended to be used by the mRelief eligibilty screener web application.
